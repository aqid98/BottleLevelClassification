# BottleLevelClassification

## Description

There are 2 types of bottles: those filled with Coca-Cola and others are filled with water. A post-processing was done to make sure each picture has the same size.

Each bottle has five different degrees of liquid amount (this is what you need to classify):

0%(labeled as 0)
25%(labeled as 1)
50%(labeled as 2)
75%(labeled as 3)
100%(labeled as 4)
